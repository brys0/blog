# Guidelines For Thumbnail Image

The hero image or thumbnail is the first image that readers see when they
read the blog. This may be through a link preview card, or through opening
the blog page itself.

## Strict Guidelines

These are the requirements that must be followed at all costs.

- Should not be NSFW.
- Must not use material under copyright (unless permitted, like in case of a
  collaboration).
- Should not be detrimental to the general perception of V
  or collaborators.

## Aesthetic Guidelines

These should be followed to ensure that the website's look stays consistent.

- The graphic elements used must follow the [style guide](style-guide.md).
  These include components like text, which must use stipulated fonts.
- It is recommended to have the thumbnail image be in landscape mode.
- The preferred resolution is **1600x900**.
- There is no compulsion to choose images based on the official palette
  colours. It is sufficient to use them for graphic elements like text,
  icons, just enough to maintain the consistency of the design language
  and play nice with the underlying image.

## Design Hints

Suggestions to make the process of creating Thumbnail Images simpler for all
contributors.

- Same instructions for
  [optimisation](/docs/new-post-instructions.md#adding-images)
  as regular images.
- Royalty free images can be obtained from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).
  Ideally, include some modifications to the image, do not use them verbatim.
- There is no recommended image processor, photomanipulation software, or
  graphic design software. Use whatever you are comfortable with. But be sure
  to follow basic design principles and be ready for iterations (i.e. use a
  format that is editable like SVG, layered PDF, PSD, etc.)
