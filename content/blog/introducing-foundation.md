WIP

Hello, we,
[Petr Makhnev](https://github.com/i582), and
[Mark aka walkingdevel](https://github.com/walkingdevel)
from the V development team, announce the
creation of the V Software Foundation.

The Foundation is a **non-profit organization** that is dedicated to the development of the V
language.

# Prelude

For a long time, V has been developing independently; **one person** makes decisions on the
development and advertising of the language.
However, one person does not always keep track of all aspects of the development and spread of a
language.

# Founding

The development of almost any open source project is **very dependent on sponsors**.
From their financial support, the project can receive the necessary resources for development.
For example, **hire people** who will be involved in language development, documentation, testing,
etc.

However, when funding is not transparent, neither community members nor the sponsors themselves know
where the funding goes or how it is spent.

The V Software Foundation is registered on the
[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) platform,
allowing anyone interested to keep
track of where the money is going and how it's being spent.

# Deadlines

Unlike the development of the language itself, the Foundation **respects deadlines**, and we believe
that deadlines help to make the evolution of the language/ecosystem transparent.
Of course, it is not always possible to meet the deadlines, but even if the deadlines are postponed,
it is not critical if this phenomenon does not become permanent.
The Foundation will notify the community of any postponements, if any.

# Influence

Right now, the Foundation's sphere of influence is not so great, but it will expand over time.
For example, the Foundation will develop a **new Language Server** for V to compete with another
Foundation development, a plug-in for JetBrains IDE, which is currently the best development
environment for V.
