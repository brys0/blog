After V's first release, V Playground was located at
[vlang.io/play (archive.org link, August, 25, 2019)](https://web.archive.org/web/20190825140332/vlang.io/play),
it was very simple, and also contained several examples.

Next, a more advanced version of playground was then created at
[play.vlang.io (archive.org link, September, 22, 2021)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210922135352/http://play.vlang.io/).
In this version of V Playground users could change the theme, and adjust the font size, making it more accessible and easy to use.

Following the previous update of V Playground, we subsequently
[returned to online](https://twitter.com/v_language/status/1583480823151329280)
October, 21 2022.

This change came with several problems, from a slow and inconvenient editor, to an appearance I generally disliked.
In two days I created a new updated appearance, improved editor, and by October 25, 2022, the new
V playground was
[launched](https://discord.com/channels/592103645835821068/592723761812209664/1034225971324256319).

Since then, V playground has not changed much, 
[play.vlang.io](https://play.vlang.io)
remained nearly the same design as it was from when I had updated it.

After some time, playground was built under WASM, greatly improving the speed of execution by allowing the code to run directly in the browser,
without having to send code to a server for compilation, and execution.
The website for V Playground with WASM seems to be online, but itâ€™s not working for me.
It can be found at [v-wasm.vercel.app](https://v-wasm.vercel.app).

## Embeddable playground

Back in early 2023, I had an idea to make a version of V Playground that was embedded, that would mean V Playground could easily be integrated
into any site, such as a V documentation website, or just a simple blog.

The code for V Playground that is embedded is currently separate project that can be found on GitHub:
[vlang-association/playground-component](https://github.com/vlang-association/playground-component)

You could already see it in action in the V documentation pages here at VOSCA, or blog pages here as well:

```v {play=true}
fn main() {
    println('Hello, playground!')
    println('Try to change the code and run it again!')
}
```

Thanks to it, we made VOSCA's blog pages and V documentation interactive!

## New Playground

In parallel with the creation of VOSCA, we started the process of transferring playground to our
site.

We have rewritten all backend, improved language support in the editor, added the ability to view
generated C code, as well as the ability to pass the parameters of compilation and program
launch.
Playground can now work with base64 encoded code and GitHub Gists code.
The new playground also now can check the output of the program to match the output that was
passed as the expected output.
This is a useful feature for creating interactive lessons.

We also changed the look to better match the VOSCA style.

The new playground also updates the V version every 6 hours to always use the latest version of the
language.

The new version is also better optimized for mobile devices, allowing you to use playground on your
phone.

Playground now has [documentation](https://docs.vosca.dev/tools/playground.html) where we collected
all the information about it.

### Show generated C code

The main feature of the new playground is the ability to view generated C code.
In this mode, the editor window opens to the right where you can view the generated C code.

alt="Screenshot showing the C generated mode of Playground" >}}

By clicking on the lines in the V code editor, the corresponding line will be highlighted in the C
code editor.
You can learn more about this feature in
[documentation](https://docs.vosca.dev/tools/playground.html#show-generated-c-code).

### Afterword

We hope that the new playground will be useful for anyone who wants to try V or just practice it.
The ability to see generated C code will make finding some bugs in code generation much easier!

If you have any suggestions for improving playground, we will be glad to hear about them here in the
comments, in
[issues](https://github.com/vlang-association/playground/issues)
on GitHub or in
[Discord](https:///discord.gg/vlang).
